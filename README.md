# expense_db
Expense database for CSC-365

Description:
This project will be a backend api for an expense tracker. It should allow users to manage 
their expenses and track their progress. Some of the data tracked will include transaction
data such as price, time/date, item, and category. Other data could include user information
such as spending limits, income, goals, etc. With all this data, a relational database 
seems justified as it will allow us to manage many different scopes of data.
