- `date`: the date of the expense (required)
- `category`: the user defined category of the item (not required)
- `description`: the user defined description of the item (not required)

## Edge Cases and Transaction Flow:

- Users should be required to include minimum data
  - If users donâ€™t include required fields in an API called an error message should be returned
- Users should not be able to view or edit another user's information straight from an API call
  - If this is attempted an error message should be returned
- If a user attempts to create a category that already exists, it should instead update the existing category, rather than create duplicates
