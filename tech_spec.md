- `category`: the user-defined category of the item
- `over_budget`: a boolean determining whether the provided expense went over its associated budget

`get_budget(category_id)`

This endpoint returns the user's budget information. By default, it will return all the user's budget information for all categories.

- `category`: the user-defined name of a specific category
- `budget`: the budget associated with the category
- `purchases`: the purchases associated with each category
- `under_budget`: a boolean stating whether the sum of expenses associated with the category has exceeded the budget

Each purchase is represented by a dictionary with the following keys:

- `price`: the monetary value of the expense, in dollars
- `item`: the item associated with the expense
- `date`: the date of the expense

`set_budget(user, category, budget)`

This endpoint adds or updates a category with a budget. It takes as input:

- `user`: the associated user for the budget
- `category`: the user generated category to be created/updated
- `budget`: the dollar amount of the budget

`insert_expense(user, price, date, category, description)`

This endpoint adds a new expense to the database. This expense includes some required data and some optional data:

- `user`: the user who is adding the expense (required)
- `price`: the monetary value of the expense, in Dollars (required)
- `date`: the date of the expense (required)
- `category`: the user defined category of the item (not required)
- `description`: the user defined description of the item (not required)

Edge Cases and Transaction Flow:

- Users should be required to include minimum data
  - If users donâ€™t include required fields in an API called an error message should be returned
- Users should not be able to view or edit another user's information straight from an API call
  - If this is attempted an error message should be returned
- If a user attempts to create a category that already exists, it should instead update the existing category, rather than create duplicates
